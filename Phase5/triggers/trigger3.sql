-- Trigger #3 (30 points). Write a trigger that fires when the nurse ID for a bed record is changed
-- (i.e., an UPDATE). This trigger will update the Nurse.BedsMonitored for both the previous Nurse
-- and the new Nurse using their respective IDâ€™s. If the existing Nurse.BedsMonitored value for the
-- new Nurse in the update is equal to 2, then the nurse is too busy so your trigger will cancel
-- the UPDATE and display an error message stating that the Nurse is too busy (similar to the first trigger).
