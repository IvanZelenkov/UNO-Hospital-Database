-- Trigger #1 (15 points). Write a trigger that will fire when you INSERT a row into the Bed table.
-- This trigger will check the value of BedsMonitored for the corresponding Nurseâ€™s ID.
-- If Nurse.BedsMonitored is less than 2, then a nurse can monitor more beds.
-- If Nurse.BedsMonitored is equal to 2, then the nurse is too busy so your trigger
-- will cancel the INSERT and display a custom error message stating that the Nurse is too busy.
-- Also, be sure to handle the inserts for bed where the NurseID is NULL.
